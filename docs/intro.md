# Welcome to the M3U Editor Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for **M3U Editor** — a lightweight tool for creating and managing M3U playlists.

This documentation provides step-by-step guides, practical examples, and reference material to help you:

- Get started quickly with a new playlist
- Add and organize tracks and playlists
- Export and share your M3U files

If you'd like, I can also add a short "Get Started" section with links to the most relevant pages.
